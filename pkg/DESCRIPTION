Description: An algorithm for general-purpose unconstrained non-linear optimization. 
	     The algorithm is of quasi-Newton type with BFGS updating of the inverse
	     Hessian and soft line search with a trust region type monitoring of the
	     input to the line search algorithm. The interface of 'ucminf' is 
	     designed for easy interchange with 'optim'.
